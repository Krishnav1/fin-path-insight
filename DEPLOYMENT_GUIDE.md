# FinPath Insight Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying your FinPath Insight frontend application to Netlify with the enhanced error handling system we've implemented.

## What We've Done

1. **Enhanced Error Handling System**
   - Created a centralized error handling utility in `frontend/src/utils/errorHandler.js`
   - Implemented a reusable error display component in `frontend/src/components/common/ErrorDisplay.jsx`
   - Updated the API service to use the error handling system
   - Integrated the error handling into the IndianStockDashboard component

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up environment variables for development and production
   - Configured the Vite build process to use the correct API URL based on environment

3. **Netlify Configuration**
   - Created a `netlify.toml` file with proxy settings for the API
   - Added a custom 404 page for better error handling
   - Created deployment scripts to simplify the process

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Using the Deployment Script (Recommended)

1. Open a command prompt in the project directory
2. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   deploy.bat
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to log in to Netlify if needed
4. The script will build the project and deploy it to Netlify

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Build the project for production:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy to Netlify using the CLI:
   ```
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment

### Option 3: Continuous Deployment via GitHub

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Log in to your Netlify account and click "New site from Git"
3. Select GitHub as your Git provider and authorize Netlify
4. Select your repository
5. Configure the build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
6. Click "Deploy site"

## Post-Deployment Configuration

After deploying your site, you may need to configure some additional settings:

1. **Environment Variables**
   In your Netlify site dashboard, go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment:
   - Add `VITE_API_BASE_URL` with the value of your FastAPI backend URL
   - Add `VITE_API_ENVIRONMENT` with the value `production`

2. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - In your Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings > Domain management
   - Click "Add custom domain" and follow the instructions

## Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test the following:

1. **API Connectivity**
   - Verify that the frontend can connect to the FastAPI backend
   - Check that data is loading correctly in all components

2. **Error Handling**
   - Test the error handling by temporarily disabling your backend
   - Verify that error messages are displayed correctly
   - Test the retry functionality in the error display component

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Test the application on different devices and screen sizes
   - Ensure that all components render correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your deployment:

1. **API Connection Issues**
   - Check the browser console for CORS errors
   - Verify that the proxy settings in `netlify.toml` are correct
   - Ensure that your backend is accessible from the internet

2. **Build Errors**
   - Check the build logs in the Netlify dashboard
   - Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly
   - Check for syntax errors in your code

3. **Environment Variable Issues**
   - Verify that environment variables are set correctly in Netlify
   - Check that the variables are being used correctly in your code

## Next Steps

Now that your frontend is deployed, consider implementing:

1. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Set up Netlify Analytics to track site traffic
   - Implement error tracking with a service like Sentry

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Analyze and optimize asset loading
   - Implement code splitting for faster initial load times

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add Content Security Policy headers
   - Implement rate limiting for API requests
