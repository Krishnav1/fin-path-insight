## Multiple Tickers with One Request
Add the ‘s=’ parameter to your URL, and you will be able to retrieve data for multiple tickers in a single request. All tickers should be separated by a comma. For example, you can request data for AAPL.US, VTI, and EUR.FOREX with the following URL:

```
https://eodhd.com/api/real-time/AAPL.US?s=VTI,EUR.FOREX&api_token=demo&fmt=json
```

$curl = curl_init();

curl_setopt_array($curl, array(
    CURLOPT_URL => 'https://eodhd.com/api/real-time/AAPL.US?s=VTI,EUR.FOREX&api_token=demo&fmt=json',
    CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
    CURLOPT_ENCODING => '',
    CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS => 10,
    CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 0,
    CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION => true,
    CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION => CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1,
    CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST => 'GET',
));

$data = curl_exec($curl);
curl_close($curl);

try {
    $data = json_decode($data, true, 512, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR);
    var_dump($data);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Error. '.$e->getMessage();
}

Please note that ‘AAPL.US’ is used here at the beginning, and additional tickers are added with the ‘s=’ parameter.

## JSON and CSV formats
We support live (delayed) stock price data in both JSON and CSV formats. If you prefer CSV output, simply change ‘fmt=json’ to ‘fmt=csv’ or remove this parameter altogether.

## Daily limits
Our API has a limit of 100,000 requests per day, with each symbol request counting as 1 API call. For instance, a request for multiple tickers with 10 symbols will consume 10 API calls.
