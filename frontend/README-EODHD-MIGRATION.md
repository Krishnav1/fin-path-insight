# EODHD Migration & Frontend Refactor

## Summary
This migration updates the frontend and backend to use the EODHD API for all stock and market data, fully removing Alpha Vantage and legacy data dependencies. The frontend is refactored to use a centralized API service and is now compatible with the new backend data structure.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. **Centralized API Service**
- Created `src/services/stockApi.js` to handle all stock and market data requests.
- Maps EODHD API fields (`code`, `name`, `close`, `change`, `change_p`, `volume`, etc.) to frontend-friendly names (`symbol`, `name`, `currentPrice`, `change`, `changePercent`, `volume`).
- Supports fetching multiple symbols and both Indian/global markets.

### 2. **Refactored IndianStockDashboard**
- Updated `IndianStockDashboard.js` to:
  - Use the new `fetchStocks` API service for all data (indices, gainers/losers, search, stock details).
  - Remove all direct axios/legacy API calls and Alpha Vantage logic.
  - Update all field mappings to match the new EODHD-backed backend.
  - Improve error handling and loading states.
- Simulated sector performance and gainers/losers for demo purposes; in production, connect these to real backend endpoints if available.

### 3. **General Improvements**
- Modular and maintainable code structure for future development.
- All sensitive API keys are handled via environment variables on the backend.

---

## How to Use
- All stock/market data requests should now go through `src/services/stockApi.js`.
- To fetch Indian or global stocks, call `fetchStocks({ symbols: [...], market: 'indian' | 'global' })`.
- The dashboard and related components will work seamlessly with the new backend structure.

---

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Dashboard loads NIFTY and SENSEX indices from EODHD.
- [x] Top gainers/losers and sector performance are displayed (demo data or real if backend supports).
- [x] Search and stock details use the new API service and data mapping.
- [x] No legacy Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance code remains.
- [x] Error handling and loading states are robust.

---

## Next Steps
- For production, connect sector performance and gainers/losers to backend/EODHD endpoints if available.
- Expand the API service for historical data, charting, and other features as needed.
- Continue modularizing large components for maintainability.
